### COMING TOGETHER TO SHAPE OUR RAIL CORRIDOR

Through the earlier public engagement, we received many ideas on how to shape our Rail Corridor and a Concept Master Plan was developed to bring together these ideas. We will now be embarking on the next phase of this journey to activate our Rail Corridor through involvement and community stewardship.

### COAST-TO-COAST TRAIL
Rail Corridor (Central) is where our Rail Corridor and **Coast-to-Coast Trail** meet.

The 36-km **Coast-to-Coast Trail** traverses Singapore from west to northeast. It connects park connectors and park trails, and will bring visitors through a variety of parks, park connectors, nature areas, places of interest and urban spaces.

Rail Corridor (Central), together with part of the Coast-to-Coast Trail, complete the **Nature Park Network**.

The **Nature Park Network** will compromise 48km of trails and will link our central nature parks such as Bukit Batok Chestnut, Dairy Farm, Windsor as well as the future Rifle Range and Thomson Nature Parks.
